# Bellybutton biodiversity analysis

For this exercise it was used the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

# Objective
Create an interactive dashboard to review the data with:

* Table displaying each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
* Horizontal bar chart with the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
* Bubble chart that displays each sample.
* Gauge Chart with the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

# Results
Table displaying each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
